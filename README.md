        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My journey in web development started with a fascination for how the web connects the world, and over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I strive to build websites and applications that not only look good but also provide an intuitive user experience.With a background in both design and development, I enjoy bridging the gap between aesthetics and functionality. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and best practices to improve the quality of my work. I have a strong foundation in backend technologies as well, including Node.js and Python, allowing me to contribute to full-stack development projects.When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy solving challenging problems in competitive programming, experimenting with new web technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects and grow as a developer.</p>
